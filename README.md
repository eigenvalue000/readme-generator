## Description
The Readme Generator uses node.js with the file system
and inquirer packages to create a prompt in the
command line interface that accepts inputs for
the project title, the author, the copyright year,
the description of the project, a table of
contents for a large project, the installation
instructions, the usage of the application,
the license selected among multiple possible license
choices, a section for contributions to the project,
a section for the tests used on the application,
and a contact section for if someone wants to ask
the author questions about the project. This is then
written to a markdown file.
