## Author
Garrett Kegel

## Description
The Readme Generator uses node.js with the file system and inquirer packages to create a prompt in the command line interface that accepts inputs for the project title, the author, the copyright year, the description of the project, a table of contents for a large project, the installation instructions, the usage of the application, the license selected among multiple possible license choices, a section for contributions to the project, a section for the tests used on the application, and a contact section for if someone wants to ask the author questions about the project. This is then written to a markdown file.
